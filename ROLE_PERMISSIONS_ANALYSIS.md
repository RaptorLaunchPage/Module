# Role Permissions Analysis & Fixes

## Current Role Structure

### 🔴 Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent Dashboard Access**: Admin and Manager both have dashboard tab but display different content
2. **Missing Match Details**: Admin/Manager dashboard lacks match details and history that should be available
3. **Incomplete Data Display**: Performance Report not showing full functionality for all roles
4. **Inconsistent Filtering**: Different filtering capabilities across roles

## Expected Role Permissions

### **Admin** 👑
- **Access**: Everything
- **Performance Dashboard**: 
  - ✅ Should see: Match details, history, filterable by player/map
  - ✅ Should see: All teams' performance data
  - ✅ Should see: Comprehensive statistics and analytics
- **Performance Report**: Full access with all statistics
- **Management**: Can add/edit/delete all performance data
- **OCR**: Full access to OCR extraction tools

### **Manager** 📊
- **Access**: Same as Admin (management level)
- **Performance Dashboard**: 
  - ✅ Should see: Match details, history, filterable by player/map
  - ✅ Should see: All teams' performance data (same as admin)
  - ✅ Should see: Comprehensive statistics and analytics
- **Performance Report**: Full access with all statistics
- **Management**: Can add/edit performance data
- **OCR**: Full access to OCR extraction tools

### **Coach** 🏆
- **Access**: Team-specific data only
- **Performance Dashboard**: 
  - ✅ Should see: Their team's match details and history
  - ✅ Should see: Filterable by their team's players/maps
- **Performance Report**: Team-specific statistics
- **Management**: Can add performance data for their team
- **OCR**: Can extract data for their team

### **Player** 🎮
- **Access**: Personal data only
- **Performance Dashboard**: ❌ Should not have dashboard tab
- **Performance Report**: Personal statistics only
- **Management**: Can submit their own performance data
- **OCR**: ❌ No OCR access

## Current Implementation Issues

### 1. Performance Dashboard Content Mismatch
**Problem**: Admin and Manager have dashboard access but content doesn't match expected functionality

**Solution**: Enhance `PerformanceDashboard` component to show:
- Match details table with full information
- Performance history with filtering
- Advanced statistics and analytics
- Role-appropriate data filtering

### 2. Performance Report Inconsistency  
**Problem**: Still showing debug/test data instead of real dashboard

**Solution**: Remove all debug output and show production-ready performance analytics

### 3. Role Logic Inconsistency
**Problem**: Admin and Manager should have identical access but implementation differs

**Current Logic**:
```typescript
const canEdit = ["admin", "manager", "coach"].includes(role)
const canViewDashboard = ["admin", "manager"].includes(role)
```

**Fixed Logic**: ✅ This is actually correct

## Fixes Needed

### Priority 1: Fix Performance Dashboard Content
- Add match details table
- Add performance history
- Add advanced filtering (player, map, date range)
- Add comprehensive statistics

### Priority 2: Clean Up Performance Report
- Remove debug information  
- Show production-ready analytics
- Ensure role-appropriate data display

### Priority 3: Verify Role Consistency
- Ensure Admin and Manager see identical interfaces
- Verify data filtering works correctly
- Test all role combinations

## Expected User Experience by Role

1. **Performance Tab** → **Dashboard Tab**: See full match details, history, filterable data
2. **Performance Tab** → **Report Tab**: See comprehensive performance analytics
3. **Performance Tab** → **Add Performance Tab**: Can add new performance data
4. **Performance Tab** → **OCR Extract Tab**: Can extract data via OCR

### Player Login:
1. **Performance Tab** → **Report Tab**: See personal analytics only

## Implementation Status

- ❌ Performance Report needs cleanup  
- ❌ Need to verify data filtering accuracy
