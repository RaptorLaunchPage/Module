## [2024-01-20] - Authentication Flow Fixes & Codebase Cleanup

### ðŸ”§ Authentication Issues Fixed

#### Problem
Users were getting stuck at the last stage of authentication instead of being redirected to the dashboard after successful login/signup.

#### Root Causes Identified & Fixed
1. **Profile Creation Issue**: New profiles were created with `pending_player` role but without the `onboarding_completed` flag being set to `false`
2. **Conflicting Redirect Logic**: Multiple components were trying to handle redirects simultaneously, causing conflicts
3. **Onboarding State Detection**: The auth flow wasn't properly detecting when onboarding was completed

#### Changes Made

**lib/secure-profile-creation.ts**
- âœ… Added explicit `onboarding_completed: false` for new pending_player profiles
- âœ… Ensures proper routing behavior for new users

**lib/auth-flow-v2.ts**
- âœ… Updated `setAuthenticatedState` to handle redirects more carefully
- âœ… Added logic to avoid multiple redirect attempts
- âœ… Improved dashboard routing for completed profiles

**hooks/use-auth-v2.tsx**
- âœ… Updated Supabase auth event handler to prevent conflicting redirects
- âœ… Added path checking to avoid unnecessary redirects
- âœ… Improved sign-in flow to let auth events handle redirects

**components/route-guard-v2.tsx**
- âœ… Better handling of onboarding status
- âœ… Prevented conflicting redirects between components

**app/page.tsx**
- âœ… More specific logic for determining onboarding vs dashboard buttons
- âœ… Proper role and onboarding status checking

**app/onboarding/page.tsx**
- âœ… Added auth state refresh after profile completion
- âœ… Ensures auth flow recognizes profile changes immediately

### ðŸ§¹ Codebase Cleanup

#### Removed Files
- âœ… Deleted 20+ outdated markdown documentation files
- âœ… Removed debug pages and API routes:
  - `app/dashboard/debug/page.tsx`
  - `app/api/debug/env/route.ts`
  - `app/api/profile/debug/route.ts`
  - `lib/env-debug.ts`
- âœ… Cleaned up temporary documentation files

#### Organized Files
- âœ… Moved SQL files to `database/` directory for better organization
- âœ… Kept only essential documentation:
  - `README.md` - Updated with current features and setup
  - `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Updated with current API endpoints
  - `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
  - `DATABASE.md` - Database schema documentation

#### Updated Documentation
- âœ… **README.md**: Completely rewritten with current features, setup instructions, and tech stack
- âœ… **API_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Updated with current API endpoints and authentication
- âœ… **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Comprehensive deployment guide for Vercel + Supabase

### âœ… Testing & Validation
- âœ… Build process completed successfully
- âœ… All TypeScript types validated
- âœ… ESLint warnings reviewed (non-breaking)
- âœ… Authentication flow logic verified

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results
1. **Smooth Authentication**: Users should now be properly redirected to dashboard after login/signup
2. **Proper Onboarding Flow**: New users will be correctly guided through onboarding before accessing dashboard
3. **Clean Codebase**: Removed ~25 unnecessary files and organized remaining files properly
4. **Updated Documentation**: All documentation now reflects the current state of the application
