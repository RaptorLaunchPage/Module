# Agreement System Refactor - Complete Implementation

## Summary

Successfully refactored the agreement check logic and fixed UI issues to provide a better user experience and performance. The system now checks agreement status only once after authentication and provides a proper modal interface.

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Performance Issues Fixed**
- **Before**: Agreement check ran on every page load, including 404 routes
- **After**: Agreement check runs only once after login/authentication
- **Result**: Significant performance improvement and reduced API calls

### 2. **UI Issues Fixed**
- **Before**: Agreement screen sometimes failed to appear correctly due to z-index/animation issues
- **After**: Proper modal with `z-index: 9999`, backdrop blur, and interaction prevention
- **Result**: Agreement modal always appears correctly and prevents interaction with main app

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### **New Centralized State Management**

#### 1. **AgreementProvider** (`hooks/use-agreement-context.tsx`)
- Centralized agreement state management using React Context
- Checks agreement status only once after authentication
- Stores `hasAcceptedAgreement` in global state
- Automatically resets state on logout
- Handles development override for testing

#### 2. **AgreementModal** (`components/agreement-modal.tsx`)
- Improved modal component with proper z-index (`z-[9999]`)
- Prevents body scroll and interaction with main app
- Better UI with backdrop blur and proper styling
- Maintains existing agreement review functionality
- Emergency admin bypass functionality preserved

#### 3. **AgreementRouteGuard** (`components/agreement-route-guard.tsx`)
- Simplified route protection logic
- Only handles redirects to agreement review page
- No longer manages agreement state (delegated to context)
- Better separation of concerns

### **Updated Root Layout**
```tsx
<AuthProvider>
  <AgreementProvider>          // New: Centralized agreement state
    <AgreementRouteGuard>      // New: Simplified route guard
      {children}
    </AgreementRouteGuard>
    <AgreementModal />         // New: Global modal component
    <Toaster />
  </AgreementProvider>
</AuthProvider>
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **State Management Flow**
1. User logs in → `AuthProvider` sets user/profile
2. `AgreementProvider` detects user change → checks agreement status (once)
3. If agreement required → `showAgreementModal` set to true
4. `AgreementModal` renders with proper z-index and backdrop
5. User accepts/declines → state updated, modal closed
6. `AgreementRouteGuard` handles route protection based on state

### **Key Features**
- **Single Check**: Agreement status checked only once per session
- **Global State**: Agreement state managed centrally via Context API
- **Proper Modal**: z-index 9999, backdrop blur, interaction prevention
- **Route Protection**: Seamless redirects without breaking navigation
- **Development Override**: Respects `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_AGREEMENT_ENFORCEMENT`
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if agreement check fails
