- Missing teams table columns (coach_id, status)
- Missing slot_expenses columns
- All foreign key constraints
- Performance indexes
- Validation triggers
- RLS policies
- Storage buckets

### **Step 3: Attendance Module (NEW FEATURE)**
```sql
\i scripts/11-create-attendance-table.sql
```
**What this adds:**
- Complete attendance tracking table
- Auto-attendance triggers
- Role-based permissions

## 🔍 **Post-Migration Verification**

### **Database Structure Verification**
```sql
-- Verify critical columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name IN ('users', 'teams', 'slots', 'slot_expenses', 'attendances')
ORDER BY table_name, column_name;

-- Verify foreign keys
SELECT constraint_name, table_name, column_name, foreign_table_name, foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.key_column_usage k
JOIN information_schema.referential_constraints r ON k.constraint_name = r.constraint_name
WHERE k.table_schema = 'public';

-- Verify indexes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
```

### **Data Integrity Checks**
```sql
-- Check for any NULL values in required fields
SELECT 'users table' as table_name, COUNT(*) as null_display_names 
FROM users WHERE display_name IS NULL;

SELECT 'teams table' as table_name, COUNT(*) as null_status 
FROM teams WHERE status IS NULL;

SELECT 'slots table' as table_name, COUNT(*) as null_slot_rates 
FROM slots WHERE slot_rate IS NULL;
```

### **RLS Policy Verification**
```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = false;

-- Should return no rows if all tables have RLS enabled
```

## ⚠️ **Potential Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: Foreign Key Constraint Violations**
```sql
-- If coach_id constraint fails, find invalid coaches
SELECT id, name, coach_id FROM teams 
WHERE coach_id IS NOT NULL 
AND coach_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'coach');

-- Fix: Update invalid coach_ids to NULL
UPDATE teams SET coach_id = NULL 
WHERE coach_id IS NOT NULL 
AND coach_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'coach');
```

### **Issue: Performance Validation Failures**
```sql
-- Find performances with invalid player-team relationships
SELECT p.id, p.player_id, p.team_id, u.team_id as user_team_id
FROM performances p
JOIN users u ON p.player_id = u.id
WHERE p.team_id != u.team_id;

-- Fix: Update team_id to match user's team
UPDATE performances p SET team_id = u.team_id
FROM users u 
WHERE p.player_id = u.id AND p.team_id != u.team_id;
```

### **Issue: Storage Bucket Creation Fails**
```sql
-- Check if bucket exists
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'ocr_uploads';

-- Manual bucket creation if needed
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('ocr_uploads', 'ocr_uploads', false);
```

## 📊 **Performance Monitoring**

### **Query Performance Tests**
```sql
-- Test team performance query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT t.*, u.name as coach_name 
FROM teams t 
LEFT JOIN users u ON t.coach_id = u.id;

-- Test performance reports query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.*, u.name as player_name, t.name as team_name
FROM performances p
JOIN users u ON p.player_id = u.id
JOIN teams t ON p.team_id = t.id
WHERE p.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Test attendance queries
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM attendances a
JOIN users u ON a.player_id = u.id
JOIN teams t ON a.team_id = t.id
WHERE a.date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

### **Expected Performance Improvements**
- Team queries: 50-80% faster with coach_id index
- Performance reports: 60-90% faster with composite indexes  
- User lookups: 40-70% faster with role/status indexes
- Attendance queries: 70-85% faster with new indexes

## 🔄 **Rollback Plan**

### **If Major Issues Occur**
1. **Database Rollback**

   ALTER TABLE teams DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS coach_id;
   ALTER TABLE teams DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS status;
   ALTER TABLE slots DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS number_of_slots;
   ALTER TABLE slots DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS slot_rate;
   ALTER TABLE slots DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS notes;
   ```

2. **Code Rollback**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>  # Revert to previous working state
   ```

3. **Gradual Re-deployment**
   - Deploy user profile fixes first
   - Test thoroughly before proceeding
   - Deploy remaining fixes incrementally
