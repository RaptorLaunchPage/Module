# 🗓️ Attendance Module Implementation

## ✅ Overview

The Attendance Module has been successfully implemented to track both **match-based auto attendance** and **manual practice session attendance** for esports players across teams. The module follows the existing application's design patterns and role-based permission system.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### `attendances` Table

| Field         | Type        | Description                             |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `id`          | UUID        | Primary key                             |
| `player_id`   | UUID        | FK to `users.id`                        |
| `team_id`     | UUID        | FK to `teams.id`                        |
| `date`        | Date        | Date of attendance                      |
| `session_time`| Enum        | `Morning`, `Evening`, `Night`, `Match` |
| `status`      | Enum        | `Present`, `Absent`, `Auto (Match)`     |
| `marked_by`   | UUID        | User who marked attendance (nullable for auto) |
| `slot_id`     | UUID        | FK to `slots.id` (for match attendance) |
| `created_at`  | Timestamp   | Auto-filled                             |

### Unique Constraints
- Prevents duplicate attendance for same player, date, and session: `UNIQUE(player_id, date, session_time)`

### Indexes
- `idx_attendances_player_date` - For player-specific queries
- `idx_attendances_team_date` - For team-specific queries  
- `idx_attendances_session_date` - For session-specific queries
- `idx_attendances_slot_id` - For slot-specific queries

## 🔐 Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

### View Policies
1. **Players can view own attendance** - Players can only see their own records
2. **Team members can view team attendance** - Coaches, admins, managers, analysts can view their team's records
3. **Admins and managers can view all attendance** - Full access for admin/manager roles

### Insert Policies
1. **Players can mark own attendance** - Players can only mark their own attendance
2. **Coaches can mark team attendance** - Coaches can mark attendance for their team players
3. **Admins and managers can mark any attendance** - Full marking permissions
4. **System can insert auto attendance** - For automatic match attendance creation

## 🔄 Auto Attendance System

### Trigger Function: `create_auto_attendance()`
- **Triggered by**: INSERT on `performances` table
- **Logic**: 
  - Extracts slot information if available (date, team_id)
  - Creates attendance record with status `'Auto (Match)'`
  - Uses slot date if available, otherwise current date
  - Prevents duplicates for same player/date/session

### Integration with Performance Module
- When a performance entry is created, attendance is automatically marked
- Links to specific slot if performance is slot-based
- Seamless integration without breaking existing functionality
