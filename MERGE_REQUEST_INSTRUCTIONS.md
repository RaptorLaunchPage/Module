**Title**: 
```
🔐 Fix Authentication Issues: Resolve Login Stuck States and Profile Creation
```

**Description**: 
```markdown
## 🎯 Problem Solved

This PR completely resolves the authentication issues where:
- Form login was getting stuck on 'Signing in...' animation
- Discord OAuth was stuck on 'Loading your account' infinitely  
- Users experienced 'Profile not found' errors

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified

The issue was a **foreign key constraint violation** in the database:
- The `users` table has FK constraint: `users.id` must reference `auth.users(id)`
- Profile creation was happening outside authenticated session context
- This caused FK constraint violations and authentication failures

## 🛠️ Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Profile Creation Logic
- ✅ Added session verification before profile creation
- ✅ Ensured user ID matches authenticated session
- ✅ Proper foreign key constraint error handling  
- ✅ Clear error messages for different failure types

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Flow
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Proper redirect handling after authentication
- ✅ Better error propagation and handling
- ✅ Consistent behavior for all auth methods

### 3. Improved User Experience
- ✅ Appropriate loading states
- ✅ Graceful error handling with recovery options
- ✅ Clear user feedback and messaging
- ✅ Automatic redirects after successful login

## ✅ Issues Resolved

- ❌ Form login stuck on 'Signing in...' - **FIXED**
- ❌ Discord OAuth infinite loading - **FIXED**
- ❌ Profile not found errors - **FIXED**  
- ❌ Inconsistent auth behavior - **FIXED**

## 🚀 Result

The authentication system now provides:
- **Reliable form-based login** with email/password
- **Working Discord OAuth** with proper redirects
- **Seamless profile creation** for both auth methods  
- **Clear error handling** with recovery options
- **Consistent user experience** regardless of login method

The authentication system is now **production-ready** with robust error handling and smooth user experience.
```
