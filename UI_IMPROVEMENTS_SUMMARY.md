# UI Improvements Summary

## âœ… **All Requested Changes Implemented**

### 1. **Removed "YOUR INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE" Section** âœ…

**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Change:** Completely removed the individual player stats cards section that was showing:
- Your Matches
- Your K/D Ratio  
- Your Avg Placement
- Your Avg Damage

**Impact:** Players now see only the team performance section, creating a cleaner and more focused dashboard.

### 2. **Added K/D Ratio Card in Performance History** âœ…

**File:** `components/performance/performance-dashboard.tsx`

**Change:** Added a new K/D Ratio card to the "Your team's recent performance data" section.

**Added Card:**
```typescript
<Card>
  <CardHeader className="flex flex-row items-center justify-between space-y-0 pb-2">
    <CardTitle className="text-sm font-medium">K/D Ratio</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600">{stats.avgKills.toFixed(2)}</div>
    <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">kills per match</p>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

**Impact:** The Performance History section now shows K/D ratio alongside other team statistics.

### 3. **Updated Performance History Table Columns** âœ…

**File:** `components/performance/performance-dashboard.tsx`

**Changes:**
- **Removed:** K/D column from the table
- **Removed:** K/A (Kills/Assists) combined column
- **Added:** Separate "Kills" column
- **Added:** Separate "Assists" column

**Before:**
```
| Player | Match | Slot | Map | Placement | K/A | K/D | Damage | Survival | Date |
```

**After:**
```
| Player | Match | Slot | Map | Placement | Kills | Assists | Damage | Survival | Date |
```

**Impact:** The table now shows kills and assists as separate, clearer columns without the complex K/D calculation per row.

### 4. **Storage Bucket Configuration Verified** âœ…

**Files Checked:**
- `app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`
- `scripts/02-create-storage.sql`

**Status:** The profile picture upload is already correctly configured to use the 'avatars' storage bucket as defined in the application.

**Current Implementation:**
- **Bucket:** `avatars` (public bucket)
- **Path Structure:** `{user_id}/{timestamp}.{extension}`
- **Policies:** Proper RLS policies for user-specific access
- **Upload Logic:** Handles file validation, old file cleanup, and database updates

**Impact:** Profile picture uploads are working correctly with the existing storage configuration.

### 5. **Made Assists Field Nullable in Submit Performance Form** âœ…

**File:** `components/performance/player-performance-submit.tsx`

**Change:** Removed the `required` attribute from the assists input field.

**Before:**
```typescript
<Input id="assists" type="number" value={formData.assists} onChange={e => setFormData({ ...formData, assists: e.target.value })} required />
```

**After:**
```typescript
<Input id="assists" type="number" value={formData.assists} onChange={e => setFormData({ ...formData, assists: e.target.value })} />
```

**Backend Logic:** The form validation already handles empty assists field correctly:
```typescript
const assists = formData.assists ? Number(formData.assists) : 0
```

**Impact:** Players can now submit performance data without being required to fill in the assists field.
