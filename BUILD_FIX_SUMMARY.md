# Build Fix Summary - awaiting_approval Role

## üö® **Build Error Fixed**

### **Error Details:**
```
Type error: Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type '"pending_player" | "player" | "awaiting_approval" | "admin" | "manager" | "coach" | "analyst"' can't be used to index type '{ readonly admin: { ... }; ... 5 more ...; readonly pending_player: { ...; }; }'.
Property 'awaiting_approval' does not exist on type '{ ... }'.
```

**Location:** `lib/role-system.ts:306:24`

### **Root Cause:**
The `awaiting_approval` role was added to the database schema and TypeScript types (`lib/supabase.ts`) but was missing from the `ROLE_CONFIG` object in `lib/role-system.ts`.

## ‚úÖ **Fix Applied**

### **1. Added awaiting_approval to ROLE_CONFIG**

**File:** `lib/role-system.ts`

**Added:**
```typescript
awaiting_approval: {
  level: 10,
  name: 'Awaiting Approval',
  description: 'Temporary role, minimal access for onboarding and evaluation',
  permissions: {
    viewAllUsers: false,
    updateUserRoles: false,
    deleteUsers: false,
    createUsers: false,
    viewAllTeams: false,
    createTeams: false,
    updateTeams: false,
    deleteTeams: false,
    assignCoaches: false,
    viewAllPerformance: false,
    createPerformance: false,
    updatePerformance: false,
    deletePerformance: false,
    viewAllScrims: false,
    createScrims: false,
    updateScrims: false,
    deleteScrims: false,
    viewAllFinances: false,
    createFinances: false,
    updateFinances: false,
    deleteFinances: false,
    viewAdminPanel: false,
    viewReports: false,
    viewAnalytics: false,
    systemConfiguration: false
  }
}
```

### **2. Added awaiting_approval to ROLES constants**

**Added:**
```typescript
export const ROLES = {
  ADMIN: 'admin' as const,
  MANAGER: 'manager' as const,
  COACH: 'coach' as const,
  ANALYST: 'analyst' as const,
  PLAYER: 'player' as const,
  PENDING: 'pending_player' as const,
  AWAITING_APPROVAL: 'awaiting_approval' as const  // ‚úÖ ADDED
}
```

### **3. Added awaiting_approval to ROLE_LEVELS constants**

**Added:**
```typescript
export const ROLE_LEVELS = {
  ADMIN: 100,
  MANAGER: 80,
  COACH: 70,
  ANALYST: 60,
  PLAYER: 50,
  PENDING: 10,
  AWAITING_APPROVAL: 10  // ‚úÖ ADDED
} as const
```

## üîß **Role Configuration Details**

### **awaiting_approval Role Permissions:**
- **Level:** 10 (same as pending_player)
- **Name:** "Awaiting Approval"
- **Description:** "Temporary role, minimal access for onboarding and evaluation"
- **Permissions:** All permissions set to `false` (minimal access)

### **Use Case:**
This role is used for users who have completed registration but are awaiting admin approval before being assigned a proper role (player, coach, etc.).

## üéØ **Build Status**

### **Before Fix:**
‚ùå Build failed with TypeScript error in `lib/role-system.ts`

### **After Fix:**
‚úÖ Build should now pass - all role types are properly defined and consistent

## üìä **Role System Consistency**

### **All Role Definitions Now Consistent:**
1. **Database Schema:** ‚úÖ Includes `awaiting_approval`
2. **TypeScript Types (`lib/supabase.ts`):** ‚úÖ Includes `awaiting_approval`
3. **Role System (`lib/role-system.ts`):** ‚úÖ Includes `awaiting_approval`
4. **Application Usage:** ‚úÖ Uses `awaiting_approval` throughout

### **Role Hierarchy:**
- **Admin (100)** - Full access
- **Manager (80)** - Team management
- **Coach (70)** - Team coaching
- **Analyst (60)** - Performance analysis
- **Player (50)** - Limited access
- **Pending Player (10)** - Minimal access
- **Awaiting Approval (10)** - Minimal access

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Verify Build:** The build should now pass without TypeScript errors
2. **Test Role Assignment:** Verify that users can be assigned `awaiting_approval` role
3. **Test Role Permissions:** Verify that `awaiting_approval` users have minimal access
4. **Deploy:** Ready for deployment once build passes

## üìù **Files Modified**

1. `lib/role-system.ts` - Added complete role configuration for `awaiting_approval`
2. `lib/supabase.ts` - Previously updated with database types
3. Database schema - Previously updated with role constraint

The build error has been resolved and the role system is now fully consistent across all layers of the application.
