# Role Testing Guide

## Testing Role Permissions

### Test User: Manager (Current)
**Profile**: RExMANAGER  
**Role**: manager  
**Expected Access**: Same as Admin (full management access)

### What You Should See:

#### 1. Performance Module Navigation
- âœ… Performance in sidebar â†’ Click should open Performance module with tabs

#### 2. Performance Module Tabs (Manager Role)
- âœ… **ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard** - Should be first/default tab
- âœ… **ðŸ“Š Performance Report** - Should show analytics
- âœ… **âž• Add Performance** - Should allow adding performance data  
- âœ… **ðŸ“· OCR Extract** - Should allow OCR extraction

#### 3. Dashboard Tab Content (Admin/Manager)
Since you have **0 performances** in database:
- âœ… Should show filters: "All Players" dropdown, "All Maps" dropdown
- âœ… Should show message: "No performance data found for the selected filters."
- âœ… Should show summary cards with 0 values
- âœ… Should NOT crash or show errors

#### 4. Performance Report Tab Content
- âœ… Should show 4 statistics cards: 
  - Total Performances: 0
  - This Week: 0  
  - Active Teams: 4
  - Active Players: 5
- âœ… Should show: "No performance data found"
- âœ… Should show: "Performances will appear here as they are submitted"
- âœ… Should show debug info: "User: manager | Loaded: 5 users, 4 teams"

## Expected vs Current Behavior

### âœ… Working Correctly:
1. **Role Logic**: Manager gets same access as Admin
2. **Tab Visibility**: Correct tabs shown for Manager role
3. **Data Security**: Role-based filtering implemented
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of empty data
5. **Navigation**: Fixed performance module access

### ðŸ”§ Needs Verification:
1. **Dashboard Content**: Should show comprehensive table (currently shows "no data" because database is empty)
2. **Performance Report**: Clean interface without debug info (you may see cached version)
3. **Add Performance**: Should work for adding new performance data
4. **OCR Extract**: Should work for data extraction

## Test with Sample Data

To properly test the dashboard functionality, you need sample performance data:

### Quick Test Data Creation:
1. Go to **Add Performance** tab
2. Add a few sample performances with different:
   - Players (from your 5 users)
   - Teams (from your 4 teams)  
   - Maps (different map names)
   - Various statistics (kills, damage, etc.)

### After Adding Data:
1. **Dashboard Tab** should show:
   - Populated statistics cards
   - Filterable table with match details
   - Working player/map filters

2. **Performance Report Tab** should show:
   - Real statistics instead of 0s
   - Recent performances list
   - Proper analytics

## Role Comparison Testing

### Manager vs Admin (Should be Identical):
- Same tabs available
- Same data visible  
- Same filtering options
- Same management capabilities

### Manager vs Coach (Should be Different):
- Manager: Sees all teams' data
- Coach: Should only see their team's data

### Manager vs Player (Should be Very Different):
- Manager: Has Dashboard + management tabs
- Player: Only has Report + Submit tabs, no Dashboard
