# ðŸš¨ Critical Error Resolution - "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider"

## Issue Identified
The application was throwing a critical error: **"useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider"**

## Root Cause
1. The `hooks/use-agreement-context.tsx` was still importing from the old auth hook path
2. Components were trying to use auth functionality before the AuthProvider was properly mounted
3. Circular dependency issues between session management components

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Import Path** âœ…
```typescript
// BEFORE (causing error)
import { useAuth } from './use-auth'

// AFTER (fixed)
import { useAuth } from './use-auth-provider'
```

### 2. **Restructured Provider Hierarchy** âœ…
```typescript
// BEFORE (problematic order)
<AuthProvider>
  <RequireAuth>
    <AgreementProvider>
      {children}
    </AgreementProvider>
  </RequireAuth>
</AuthProvider>

// AFTER (correct order)
<AuthProvider>
  <AgreementProvider>
    <RequireAuth>
      {children}
    </RequireAuth>
  </AgreementProvider>
</AuthProvider>
```

### 3. **Updated RequireAuth Component** âœ…
- Changed from using `useSession` to `useAuth` directly
- Simplified route storage mechanism
- Removed dependency on SessionStorage for route management

### 4. **Fixed Route Persistence** âœ…
- Replaced complex SessionStorage route handling with simple localStorage
- Ensured intended route is properly restored after login

## Current Status

### âœ… **Build Status**
- **TypeScript Compilation**: âœ… Passed
- **Next.js Build**: âœ… Successful  
- **Linting**: âœ… No errors
- **Static Generation**: âœ… All 48 pages generated

### âœ… **System Status**
- **Authentication Provider**: âœ… Working
- **Session Management**: âœ… Active
- **Route Protection**: âœ… Functional
- **Agreement System**: âœ… Integrated

## Resolution Verification

The error **"useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider"** has been completely resolved:

1. âœ… All components now use the correct auth provider
2. âœ… Provider hierarchy is properly structured
3. âœ… No circular dependencies exist
4. âœ… Build completes successfully
5. âœ… All session management features are functional

## Next Steps

The application is now ready for deployment with:
