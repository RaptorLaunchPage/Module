# Performance Report Debugging Status

## Current Status
We have successfully isolated the crash issue to **database queries** in the Performance Report component. Through progressive testing, we have confirmed:

âœ… **Component structure works**
âœ… **Navigation works** 
âœ… **useAuth hook works**
âœ… **React hooks (useState, useEffect, async functions) work**
âœ… **TypeScript compilation succeeds**
ðŸ”„ **Currently testing: Basic database queries**

## Testing Methodology
We used a progressive testing approach to isolate the root cause:

1. **Static content** â†’ âœ… WORKS
2. **useAuth hook** â†’ âœ… WORKS  
3. **React hooks + async functions** â†’ âœ… WORKS
4. **Basic database queries** â†’ ðŸ”„ CURRENTLY TESTING

## Current Test Component
`components/performance/performance-report-simple.tsx` now includes:
- Simple count query on `performances` table
- Basic select query with no joins
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Progressive query testing approach

## Original Crash Context
- **Issue**: Performance Report tab crashed with "CLIENT-SIDE EXCEPTION" 
- **Previous Investigation**: Complex database queries with foreign key joins that don't exist in schema
- **Files Previously Fixed**: Multiple components with broken Supabase foreign key syntax

## Database Query Issues Identified Previously
1. **Invalid Foreign Key Joins**: `slots!performances_slot_fkey(organizer)` - constraint doesn't exist
2. **Complex Multi-table Joins**: Attempted joins across multiple tables simultaneously
3. **Variable Scoping**: Using React state before it was loaded

## Current Test Queries
```typescript
// Test 1: Count query (safest)
const { count, error: countError } = await supabase
  .from('performances')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })

// Test 2: Simple select (no joins)
const { data: perfData, error: perfError } = await supabase
  .from('performances')
  .select('id, player_id, team_id, created_at')
  .limit(5)
```

## Next Steps for Testing

### If Current Basic Queries Work:
1. **Test role-based filtering**: Add `.eq('player_id', profile.id)` for players
2. **Test simple joins**: Try one table join at a time
3. **Test data aggregation**: Add basic math operations
4. **Test complex queries**: Gradually add back the original complex queries

### If Current Basic Queries Fail:
1. **Check RLS policies**: Verify user has permissions to read `performances` table
2. **Test with different user roles**: Admin vs Player vs Coach permissions
3. **Check database connectivity**: Verify Supabase connection works for this user
4. **Review table structure**: Ensure `performances` table exists and is accessible

## Debugging Tools in Place
- Comprehensive console logging for each query step
- Error boundaries to catch and display errors gracefully
- Progressive loading states to show exactly where failures occur
- Role and user information display for debugging permissions

## Files Modified During Investigation
- `components/performance/performance-report-simple.tsx` - Current test component
- `app/dashboard/performance/page.tsx` - Fixed navigation and graceful degradation
- `components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Removed broken Performance Report navigation
- `DATABASE_CONNECTION_FIXES.md` - Comprehensive documentation of fixes

## Expected User Testing Process
1. **User clicks Performance in sidebar** â†’ Should show Performance module with tabs
2. **User clicks Performance Report tab** â†’ Should show loading animation
3. **Component loads and executes database queries** â†’ Should show success or specific error
4. **Console logs show detailed progression** â†’ Helps identify exact failure point

## Key Questions to Answer
1. Do basic queries work for the user's role?
2. Which specific query pattern causes the crash?
3. Are there RLS permission issues?
4. Does the crash happen during query execution or data processing?

## Success Criteria
- Performance Report tab loads without crashing
- User sees either data or a helpful error message
- Console shows successful query execution
- No "CLIENT-SIDE EXCEPTION" errors
